# 🧠 Mindset Rules
- Always ask: “Why is this task important?” — understand the intent, not just the action.
- If something feels vague, ASK. Don't guess and go silent.
- Break down big tasks into small deliverables and share progress often.

# 💬 Communication Rules
- Write clear commit messages: “What changed, and why?”
- Leave thoughtful comments for future you and teammates.
- Too long message -> too hard to understand. Keep documents concise as possible.
- Keep messages concise, but don't omit context.

# 📐 Coding Rules
- Keep PRs small and focused (under 400 lines = ideal).
- Always leave the code better than you found it.
- Default to readability over cleverness.
- Log smartly. Not too noisy, not too silent.

# 📁 System & Org Rules
- Follow naming conventions — consistency > personal preference.
- Reuse components/functions when possible. DRY, but not overly abstract.
- Document things you had to look up.

# 🚨 Behavior That Gets You in Trouble
- Ignoring a vague task without clarification.
- Making assumptions that change user experience or data structure.
- Leaving without documenting edge cases or todos.
